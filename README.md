# TicTacToe-AI
# Lang: C++
A TicTacToe AI that analyzes previous match results to learn the game from scratch. It optimizes its play strategy with successive replays to counter tricky plays and prevent any chance of losing. Sacrificing computational power for methodology, I wrote this code seeking a more organic approach to game AI than the traditional graph algorithmic methods, which rely largely on brute force to calculate the best possible move.
